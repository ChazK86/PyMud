Document Version: 1.0
1. Purpose

The World Builder Engine in PyMUD is designed to allow developers and users to create and modify immersive, interactive worlds in a text-based environment. This engine provides the foundational structure for defining rooms, objects, NPCs, and other interactive elements. It works closely with the PyMUD Game Engine to ensure seamless interaction between the world-building mechanics and the actual gameplay experience.
2. Key Features
2.1 Room and Environment Creation

    Room Definitions: Users can create rooms with descriptive attributes such as names, sizes, and environmental details (e.g., “a dark, damp cave” or “a bustling marketplace”).
    Environment Properties: Rooms can have properties like lighting, temperature, or weather conditions that impact gameplay (e.g., darkness may require a player to use a torch).
    Movement Paths: Define movement options (12 directions: north, south, east, west, up, down, in, out, etc.) between rooms. Movement paths will integrate with the Game Engine to ensure proper functionality.

2.2 Object and Item Management

    Object Creation: Users can create objects or items that players can interact with (e.g., weapons, books, treasure chests). These objects will have attributes such as weight, size, and value.
    Interactive Items: Some items may have special properties (e.g., a potion that heals the player, a key that unlocks doors). These items will be linked to specific game mechanics in the Game Engine.
    Custom Properties: Developers can define custom attributes for objects, allowing for flexibility in how objects behave (e.g., an item that transforms under certain conditions).

2.3 NPC Generation

    NPC Creation: Users can create NPCs with a wide range of attributes such as name, description, and behavior patterns. NPCs can have dialogue, tasks, or specific roles within the game.
    Behavior Scripting: NPCs can be scripted to follow routines or respond to player actions using the Game Engine. This will enable developers to create complex interactions and dynamic world events.
    Stat Tracking: NPCs can have stats (e.g., health, strength, intelligence) that the Game Engine will reference during combat, conversations, or other interactions.

2.4 Procedural World Generation (Future Stage)

    Dynamic World Building: As part of future updates, the World Builder Engine will include procedural generation tools to automatically create rooms, objects, and NPCs based on predefined templates or user-defined parameters.
    Customizable Templates: Users will be able to modify templates for different world regions (e.g., forests, cities, caves) to define unique aspects for each generated area.

2.5 Interaction with Game Engine

    Seamless Integration: The World Builder Engine and Game Engine work together, ensuring that all objects, rooms, and NPCs created within the World Builder are immediately usable in the gameplay experience.
    Event Triggers: The World Builder Engine will define specific triggers (e.g., stepping on a trap, unlocking a door) that the Game Engine will handle during gameplay, activating the appropriate mechanics (damage, opening a new path, etc.).
    Dynamic Updates: Any changes made to the world through the World Builder (e.g., new rooms, altered NPC behavior) are reflected immediately in the live game environment through close synchronization between the two engines.

3. Technical Architecture
3.1 Frontend Interface

    GUI for World Building: The web-based interface will allow developers to create, edit, and manage the various components of the world, including rooms, objects, and NPCs. The interface will provide a visual representation of room connections and object placements, making it easier for developers to design complex environments.
    Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Users will be able to easily place and modify objects, rooms, and NPCs within the world using a drag-and-drop system in the GUI.

3.2 Backend System

    Data Storage: Rooms, objects, and NPCs will be stored in a NoSQL or SQL database, with structured schemas for each element. The Game Engine will reference this data in real-time during gameplay.
    Synchronization with Game Engine: The World Builder and Game Engine will share a common API for handling data synchronization. For instance, if a room is created in the World Builder, the Game Engine will automatically generate the corresponding code for room interactions (e.g., entering, exiting, searching the room).
    Version Control: Changes to the world will be tracked in a version control system, allowing developers to roll back or undo modifications if needed. This ensures stability when experimenting with new features or layouts.

3.3 Data Flow

    Input Data: Users input commands or use the GUI to create elements (rooms, objects, NPCs), which are then stored in the database and made accessible to the Game Engine.
    Game Engine Processing: The Game Engine reads the created elements and handles their in-game logic (e.g., player movement, NPC interactions). Any actions taken in-game (e.g., picking up an object, interacting with an NPC) will be processed by the Game Engine and sent back to the World Builder Engine for real-time updates.
    Output: The result of actions is immediately visible to the player, with updates to the game state being reflected both in the world and in the engine.

4. Interaction with Developers' Game Engine
4.1 Game Engine Design Integration

    Shared API: The World Builder and Game Engine will share an API that handles all interactions between world creation and gameplay logic. Developers can call functions from the Game Engine directly within the World Builder to test room transitions, object interactions, and NPC behavior in real-time.
    Modular System: Both engines will be designed to be modular, allowing for easy additions of new features (e.g., a combat system, quest system). Any new module added to the Game Engine can be integrated into the World Builder without needing to redesign the entire system.
    Event-Driven Architecture: The Game Engine will be event-driven, meaning it will listen for specific triggers (e.g., entering a room, using an item) from the World Builder and react accordingly. This ensures that the two systems stay tightly linked and synchronized.

4.2 Testing and Troubleshooting

    Real-Time Testing: As users create new rooms, objects, or NPCs in the World Builder, they can immediately test them within the Game Engine. The integration between the two engines allows developers to see the results of their world-building efforts in real-time, providing instant feedback on changes or adjustments.
    Debugging Tools: The Game Engine will include debugging tools to help identify issues related to world creation (e.g., unreachable rooms, object interactions that don't trigger correctly). Any problems identified during gameplay can be traced back to the World Builder for immediate fixing.

5. Implementation Steps

    Design the Data Model: Define the database schema for rooms, objects, and NPCs. Include properties such as room descriptions, object attributes, and NPC behavior patterns.
    Build the World Builder GUI: Develop a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionality, enabling developers to build and modify the game world easily.
    Develop Backend API: Create a shared API between the World Builder and Game Engine to handle data synchronization, testing, and event triggers.
    Integrate with the Game Engine: Ensure that all rooms, objects, and NPCs created in the World Builder are fully functional in the Game Engine and that gameplay actions update the World Builder in real-time.
    Test and Debug: Perform extensive testing to ensure that the World Builder and Game Engine are tightly integrated and that all world-building elements work correctly during gameplay.

6. Future Expansion

    Procedural Generation Tools: In future updates, the World Builder will include procedural generation capabilities for automatically creating rooms, NPCs, and objects based on user-defined templates and parameters.
    Advanced NPC Behavior: NPCs will eventually gain more complex AI-driven behaviors that will be editable through the World Builder. This will allow for deeper interactions and more dynamic world events.
    Multiplayer Support: Future updates will allow the World Builder to handle multiplayer environments, where multiple players can interact with the world simultaneously.

7. Conclusion

The World Builder Engine is a core component of the PyMUD platform, providing developers with powerful tools to create immersive and interactive worlds. Its integration with the Game Engine ensures that all created elements function seamlessly during gameplay, offering a flexible and scalable environment for both development and live gameplay.
