PyMUD Project Overview

Project Name: PyMUD
Version: MVP 1.0
Created by: AutiTech
Date: [Insert Date]
Document Version: 1.0
1. Purpose

PyMUD is a web-based multi-user dungeon (MUD) platform designed to allow users to create, explore, and interact within text-based worlds. The platform integrates text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, custom natural language processing (NLP), and flexible world-building mechanics. PyMUD focuses on accessibility and affordability by avoiding reliance on costly third-party AI services, making it an ideal solution for developers with limited budgets.
2. Project Scope

The PyMUD project will consist of two key engines:

    World Builder Engine: Enables users to create and modify their own MUD worlds, including defining rooms, objects, and NPCs.
    Game Engine: Supports player interactions, movement, and real-time exploration within the generated MUD world.

The MVP will feature a robust graphical user interface (GUI), a secure login and registration system with AES-256 encryption, initial NLP functionality for command parsing and dialogue generation, and a TTS system for assigning unique voices to players and NPCs.
3. Goals and Objectives

Short-Term Goals (MVP):

    Develop a fully functional web-based GUI for users to interact with.
    Implement a secure login and registration system using AES-256 encryption.
    Create a movement system with 12 possible directions (8 compass directions + in, out, up, down).
    Introduce basic NLP to parse player commands and generate simple dialogue and world-building elements.
    Integrate TTS to assign specific voices to players and NPCs.
    Ensure scalability and low cost by avoiding external AI services.

Long-Term Goals:

    Expand the NLP system for more advanced interactions and world generation.
    Enhance the World Builder Engine with additional customization features.
    Introduce multiplayer capabilities and advanced NPC behaviors.

4. Key Features

    Login and Registration System:
        AES-256 encryption for secure user credentials.
        Unencrypted databases for world-building and game data to facilitate easy migrations.

    Graphical User Interface (GUI):
        A responsive, intuitive web interface for managing player interactions, world-building, and game control.
        User dashboard for creating and navigating game worlds.

    12-Directional Movement System:
        Movement support for 8 compass directions (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest) as well as in, out, up, and down.
        Integration with the World Builder Engine for defining exits and valid movement paths.

    NLP Integration (MVP):
        Basic command parsing for player movement and interaction.
        Templated dialogue generation for NPCs.
        Simple world-building commands to create rooms and environments (e.g., "create a forest room").

    Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration:
        Voice assignment for players and NPCs using TTS APIs (e.g., Google Cloud TTS, Amazon Polly).
        Real-time vocal output for player and NPC interactions.

5. Tech Stack

    Backend Framework: Flask (handling requests, data, and interaction)
    Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the web-based GUI
    Text-to-Speech (TTS): Google Cloud TTS or Amazon Polly for customizable voice output
    NLP Engine: Custom-built NLP leveraging spaCy or similar open-source frameworks
    Database: SQL or NoSQL for storing user data, world data, and game state

6. Timeline and Milestones

    MVP Development (Phase 1):
        GUI, login/registration, and movement system: 2-4 weeks
        Basic NLP and TTS functionality: 4-6 weeks
        Integration of World Builder and Game Engine: 4-6 weeks

    Post-MVP Expansion (Phase 2):
        Expanding NLP features for complex interactions and world generation: TBD
        Procedural world-building and real-time multiplayer integration: TBD

7. Future Considerations

    Affordability: PyMUD will remain free and open-source, ensuring developers and users with limited financial means can fully utilize the platform without subscription costs.
    Modular Design: The system will be designed for easy expansion, allowing new features (e.g., combat systems, NPC AI) to be added without overhauling core architecture.
    Community Contributions: Contributions from the open-source community will be encouraged to help improve and expand the platform over time.

8. Risks and Challenges

    Performance: Ensuring that the self-hosted NLP system scales effectively with growing data from users without sacrificing speed or accuracy.
    Technical Complexity: Balancing the real-time interactions with the system's need to maintain low latency and ensure smooth gameplay.
    Security: Protecting user data, while allowing for unencrypted game world data to ease migrations and updates.
