1. Purpose

This document outlines the phased development plan for PyMUD’s Natural Language Processing (NLP) system. The primary goal of the NLP system is to interpret player commands, facilitate interaction with the MUD world, and generate text-based responses. The system will be developed in stages, with a basic version implemented in the MVP and more advanced features introduced over time.
2. Stage 1: Basic NLP Integration (MVP)

Objective: Implement essential NLP features to parse player commands and generate simple responses for world interactions and NPC dialogues.
2.1 Features

    Command Parsing:
        The system will interpret simple commands such as:
            Movement: “move north,” “go west,” etc.
            Interactions: “look at object,” “take item,” “talk to NPC”
        Commands will be parsed by tokenizing user input and mapping it to predefined game actions.

    Dialogue Templates:
        NPCs will have predefined dialogue trees with simple responses.
        Basic conversational exchanges (e.g., "What is your name?" -> "My name is [NPC Name]").
        Use a template-based system to allow dynamic insertion of names, locations, and other variables.

    World Building:
        Users will be able to generate basic environments using text commands (e.g., “create a forest room” or “add a river”).
        The system will use predefined templates for room descriptions and objects, which can be expanded in future stages.

2.2 Technical Approach

    Library: Use spaCy for tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), and part-of-speech tagging.
    Command Mapping: Commands will be mapped to game engine actions using a simple rule-based system.
    Dialogue Generation: Predefined templates will be stored in a database or configuration file, allowing for dynamic generation of text based on player input.

2.3 Timeline:

    Command Parsing: 2-3 weeks
    Dialogue Templates: 1-2 weeks
    Basic World Building: 2 weeks

3. Stage 2: Advanced NLP Features

Objective: Expand the capabilities of the NLP system to handle more complex player interactions, including dynamic NPC conversations, procedural world generation, and context-aware commands.
3.1 Features

    Context-Aware Commands:
        The system will understand context, allowing players to refer to previous commands without repeating them. For example:
            Player: “Look at the sword.”
            Player: “Take it.”
        The system will remember the last referenced object (“sword”) and execute the appropriate action.

    Dynamic NPC Conversations:
        NPCs will be able to hold more dynamic conversations. The system will track conversational state and allow NPCs to respond based on player choices.
        Add support for conditional dialogue based on player actions or events in the world.

    Procedural World Generation:
        The NLP system will be capable of generating more complex and detailed environments based on vague or incomplete player input. For example:
            Player: “Create a desert.”
            System: “You are standing in a vast, barren desert. The sun beats down on you relentlessly.”
        The system will fill in gaps by generating random elements, such as weather, objects, or NPCs.

3.2 Technical Approach

    Library: Extend spaCy with custom rule-based processing for context tracking and object references.
    Dialogue System: Implement a state-based dialogue manager to track conversation flow and NPC responses.
    Procedural Generation: Use a mix of predefined templates and random generation algorithms to create dynamic content based on player input.

3.3 Timeline:

    Context-Aware Commands: 3-4 weeks
    Dynamic NPC Conversations: 3-5 weeks
    Procedural World Generation: 4-6 weeks

4. Stage 3: Custom NLP Model & AI-Driven World Interaction

Objective: Implement a custom-trained NLP model capable of handling more sophisticated player interactions, including AI-driven world and NPC behavior. This stage will focus on minimizing reliance on predefined templates and expanding the generative capabilities of the system.
4.1 Features

    Custom NLP Model:
        Train a custom NLP model specifically for MUD interactions, optimizing for understanding player commands, contextual queries, and world-building actions.

    AI-Driven NPCs:
        NPCs will respond to player input dynamically, generating their own responses based on context and prior interactions, rather than relying entirely on prewritten templates.
        Incorporate machine learning algorithms to allow NPCs to “learn” from interactions and evolve their responses.

    Smart World Interaction:
        The system will handle vague or ambiguous input intelligently, guiding players or asking clarifying questions when necessary (e.g., “Do you want to look at the sword or the shield?”).
        Enable complex world-building commands that dynamically create rooms, objects, and NPCs based on a player’s narrative input.

4.2 Technical Approach

    Training Data: Gather and create a dataset of MUD-specific interactions, world-building commands, and conversational patterns.
    Model: Train a custom NLP model using libraries like Hugging Face’s Transformers or similar frameworks, tailored specifically for PyMUD interactions.
    AI Algorithms: Implement reinforcement learning or other techniques to allow NPCs to adjust their behavior based on past interactions.

4.3 Timeline:

    Custom NLP Model: 6-8 weeks (including data collection and training)
    AI-Driven NPCs: 4-6 weeks
    Smart World Interaction: 5-7 weeks

5. Future Considerations
5.1 Expansion of the Command System

    As player interactions become more complex, the command parsing system will need to scale. Future updates will focus on expanding the command library and refining the system to handle edge cases or complex sentence structures.

5.2 Continuous Model Training

    The custom NLP model should be retrained periodically based on user interactions, expanding the dataset and improving the system’s accuracy and response quality over time.

5.3 Accessibility

    Ensuring that the NLP system works seamlessly with the TTS feature to provide real-time feedback to players with different accessibility needs.

6. Conclusion

The development of PyMUD’s NLP system will take place in multiple stages, beginning with a rule-based approach for basic command parsing and dialogue generation. As the system evolves, it will incorporate more advanced features such as dynamic NPC conversations, procedural world-building, and a custom-trained NLP model designed for MUD gameplay. By developing this system incrementally, PyMUD will achieve its goal of offering an affordable, accessible, and highly customizable text-based game creation platform.
