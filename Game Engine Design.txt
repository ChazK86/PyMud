Project Name: PyMUD

Document Version: 1.0
1. Purpose

The PyMUD Game Engine is the core system responsible for processing and executing all player interactions, game mechanics, and world dynamics. It works in tandem with the World Builder Engine to handle real-time responses to player commands, control NPC behavior, manage player stats, and ensure that the game environment is interactive and immersive. The engine is designed to be highly modular, allowing for future expansions such as combat, quests, and multiplayer capabilities.
2. Key Features
2.1 Command Parsing and Execution

    Player Input Handling: The Game Engine will process all player commands parsed by the NLP system (e.g., “move north,” “attack NPC,” “look at item”) and execute the appropriate game logic.
    Command-Action Mapping: Each valid command from the player will be mapped to a specific action within the game engine. Invalid or incomplete commands will prompt the system to provide feedback or request clarification.

2.2 Real-Time World Interaction

    Room and Object Interaction: Players can interact with rooms, objects, and NPCs in real time. The engine processes actions like picking up objects, unlocking doors, or manipulating items within the game world.
    Dynamic Event Triggers: The game world will react to certain triggers set in the World Builder Engine. For example, stepping on a trap may reduce the player's health, or approaching an NPC could initiate dialogue.

2.3 Player Management

    Player Stats and Inventory: Each player will have a set of stats (e.g., health, strength, intelligence) and an inventory of items they have collected. The Game Engine will track and update these stats based on player actions (e.g., combat, using items).
    Movement and Location Tracking: The engine will track player locations as they move through the world, ensuring that each movement action updates the current room and environment accordingly.

2.4 NPC Behavior and Interaction

    NPC AI: The Game Engine will manage basic NPC behaviors, including movement, dialogue, and interaction with players. NPCs can follow simple behavior scripts, such as moving between rooms or responding to player dialogue.
    Combat System (Future Update): In later updates, NPCs will have combat behaviors, allowing them to engage in battles with players or other NPCs.

2.5 Modular Event System

    Triggers and Actions: The Game Engine will support event triggers, such as walking into a specific room or using a certain item. These triggers will activate actions in the game world (e.g., opening secret doors, NPCs reacting, or starting a quest).
    Scripted Events: Developers will be able to script sequences of events that occur based on player actions. For example, a player finding a hidden item could trigger an NPC to start a quest.

3. Technical Architecture
3.1 Backend System

    Command Processing: The Game Engine will process commands sent from the frontend, through the NLP system, by interpreting the parsed data and executing corresponding actions in the game world.
    Data Management: The engine will interact with a database to update player stats, inventory, world states (e.g., room status, NPC locations), and real-time game events.

3.2 Data Flow

    Input Data: Player commands are parsed by the NLP system, and the Game Engine processes the parsed data to execute the action.
    World Interaction: Based on player actions, the engine updates the game world (e.g., moving an NPC, changing the status of an item), and the updates are reflected in both the player’s experience and the World Builder Engine.
    Output: The Game Engine generates real-time feedback to the player, whether it's through visual changes, NPC responses, or updates to the player's inventory and stats.

3.3 Modular Design

    Plugin Support: The Game Engine will be designed to easily incorporate new features or systems, such as combat or advanced quests. Each new system can be developed as a module that integrates with the existing core.
    API Integration: The Game Engine and World Builder Engine will share a common API for data synchronization, ensuring that any changes made in the World Builder (e.g., new rooms, updated NPC behavior) are immediately reflected in the live game environment.

4. Integration with World Builder Engine
4.1 Shared Data Structures

    Rooms and Objects: All rooms, objects, and NPCs created in the World Builder Engine are linked to the Game Engine, ensuring that player interactions with these elements are handled by the Game Engine in real-time.
    Dynamic Updates: Changes made to the world through the World Builder Engine (e.g., adding a new room or altering NPC dialogue) are instantly available for the Game Engine to process during gameplay.

4.2 Event Handling

    Triggers: The World Builder Engine will define certain triggers (e.g., entering a room, interacting with an object), and the Game Engine will handle the resulting events (e.g., changing player health, opening doors).
    Real-Time Updates: When a player performs an action (e.g., moving into a new room), the Game Engine updates the player’s status and synchronizes the world data to ensure consistency between the game state and the world state.

5. Core Game Systems
5.1 Movement System

    12-Directional Movement: Players can move in 12 possible directions (north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, up, down, in, out). The Game Engine processes movement commands and updates the player's current location in the game world.
    Boundaries and Exits: The Game Engine will enforce movement boundaries and ensure that players can only move to rooms with valid exits as defined in the World Builder.

5.2 Inventory and Object Management

    Item Pickup and Use: Players can pick up items, add them to their inventory, and use them when necessary. The Game Engine will manage inventory states and handle the logic for item interactions (e.g., using a key to unlock a door).
    Object Interactions: The engine will support various object interactions, such as examining items, picking up or dropping them, and using them to solve puzzles or complete tasks.

5.3 NPC Interaction System

    Basic Dialogue: Players can interact with NPCs through predefined or dynamically generated dialogue. The Game Engine will control how NPCs respond to player actions or queries.
    Future Expansion - Advanced AI: In future versions, NPCs will have more advanced AI capabilities, allowing for dynamic responses and behavior based on player interaction and world events.

6. Future Expansion
6.1 Combat System

    Turn-Based Combat: The Game Engine will handle a turn-based combat system where players and NPCs can attack, defend, or use items. This feature will include combat mechanics such as health points, damage types, and status effects.
    NPC AI in Combat: NPCs will have combat behaviors, allowing them to attack, retreat, or use items strategically based on the situation.

6.2 Quest System

    Quest Tracking: The Game Engine will include a quest system where players can accept and complete tasks assigned by NPCs. Quests can involve retrieving items, solving puzzles, or exploring specific areas of the game world.
    Dynamic Quest Generation: Future updates will allow the World Builder Engine to generate quests dynamically based on player actions and world conditions.

6.3 Multiplayer Functionality

    Real-Time Multiplayer: The Game Engine will eventually support multiplayer functionality, allowing multiple players to interact with the world and each other in real-time.

7. Implementation Steps

    Core System Setup: Build the core game systems for command processing, player movement, and basic world interaction.
    World Integration: Ensure seamless synchronization between the Game Engine and the World Builder Engine.
    NPC and Object Management: Implement NPC behaviors and object interactions.
    Testing and Debugging: Perform extensive testing to ensure smooth player interactions, world responsiveness, and stat tracking.
    Future Expansion: Plan and develop combat, quests, and multiplayer systems for future releases.

8. Conclusion

The PyMUD Game Engine is the backbone of the gameplay experience, processing player actions, managing the game world, and ensuring real-time interaction between players and the environment. Its modular design allows for continuous expansion and integration with the World Builder Engine, making it flexible and adaptable for future updates.
